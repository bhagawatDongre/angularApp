# AngularApp

Hi ,

Following are some details about assignment:

1] I am using Angular2 (As discussed I am bigginer with angular but i tried to use so assignment can be done faster).
2] As mentioned in assignment I tried to focus on below points :
* Folder structure : 
  1 ] dashboard :
  - default (main dashboard componant will load dashboard sections)
  - sections (contains componants for dashboard sections "asset overview", "network overview", "Today's Summary" will load diffrent dashboard grids in section)
  - dashbordgrids (componants for diffrent types of view which can be reused)

  2 ] search :
  - serach (search field and can show sarch result from search-result)
  - search-result (diffrent types of result view for diffrent requirement)

  3 ] table :
  - Dynamic and reusable table will expect formatted input data

* resusable code : Here I tried to make more componants by dividing elements in smaller things I have created reusable components like 'table' 'search' 'dashboardgrids' which can be used at multiple location.

* responsiveness : it is fully responsive used some media query for it.
